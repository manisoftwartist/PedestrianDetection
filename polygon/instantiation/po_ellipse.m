function ellipse = po_ellipse(center, radii, tilt, number_of_edges, resolution)
%po_ellipse: instantiation of a closed polygon sampling an ellipse
%   p = po_ellipse(c, r, t, n, s) computes a closed polygon sampling the ellipse
%   of center c, radii r, and tilt angle t with either n vertices (or
%   equivalently n edges) or a vertex every s pixels in average. The vertices
%   are regularly spaced in angle. Resolution s is used unless n is greater than
%   or equal to 3. s does not have to be an integer.
%   r can be a 1x2 or a 2x1 matrix. t is in degrees.
