function circle = po_circle(center, radius, number_of_edges, resolution)
%po_circle: instantiation of a closed polygon sampling a circle
%   p = po_circle(c, r, n, s) computes a closed polygon sampling the circle of
%   center c and radius r with either n regularly spaced vertices (or
%   equivalently n edges) or a vertex every s pixels. Resolution s is used
%   unless n is greater than or equal to 3. s does not have to be an integer.
