%ac_clipping: clipping of an active contour
%   c = ac_clipping(a, f) clips an active contour, a, so that it fits in the
%   rectangle defined by the corners (1,1) and f. f can be either a 2x1 or a 1x2
%   matrix. Actually, the clipping only guarantees that the endpoints of the
%   active contour segments lie within the rectangle. The active contour, as a
%   curve, may go outside and back inside the rectangle.

   %identical samples by the above clipping
