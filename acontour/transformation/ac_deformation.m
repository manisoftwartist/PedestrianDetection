%ac_deformation: deformation of an active contour with topology management
%   e = ac_deformation(a, d, f, r) applies a deformation, d, to an active
%   contour, a, and clips it according to some corner coordinates, f (see
%   ac_clipping), while maintaining (or imposing) a resolution of r. d is a 2xN
%   array where N is the number of segments of the active contour (or,
%   equivalently, its number of samples). If the active contour is composed of m
%   single active contours, then N is the sum of the N_i's for i ranging from 1
%   to m, where N_i is the number of segments of the i^th single active contour.
%   d is then equal to [d_1 d_2 ... d_i ...], where d_i is the deformation to
%   be applied to the i^th single active contour.
%
%   The i^th single active contour of a is sampled and its j^th sample is
%   translated by d_i(:,j). d_i(1,j) is applied to the first coordinate of the
%   sample. If the orientation of the deformed single active contour is opposite
%   to its original orientation, the deformation has transformed the contour
%   into a point and then further into some "anticontour". Therefore, the
%   contour has disappeared. If all of the single active contours disappear, e
%   is the empty array. Otherwise, each non-empty deformed single active contour
%   is tested for self-intersection and split into several simple single active
%   contours if needed. Finally, the set of deformed single active contours,
%   either originally present or resulting from a splitting, is tested for
%   cross-intersection and merging are performed if needed.
%
%   f is either a 2x1 or a 1x2 matrix. If r is positive, the length of each
%   active contour segment is approximately of r pixels. If negative, the active
%   contour is composed of abs(r) segments (or, equivalently, samples).
%
%   Known bug: in some cases of self-intersection, an active contour might
%   disappear due to a wrong estimation of the contour orientation. The active
%   contour deformation (or velocity) can be smoothed a little to try to avoid
%   this phenomenon, either through the smoothing parameter of ac_segmentation
%   or by adding a minimum length constraint to the segmentation energy.
