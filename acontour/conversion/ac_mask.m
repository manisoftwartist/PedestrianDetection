function mask = ac_mask(acontour, mask_size)
%ac_mask: conversion of an active contour into a binary mask
%   m = ac_mask(a, m_size) computes the binary mask, m, of an active contour, a.
%   The size of m is given by m_size.
%   m_size can be a 1x2 or a 2x1 matrix. The class of m is double.
%
%   Validity of the active contour is not checked. In particular, if it is
%   composed of intersecting single contours, the mask is not binary since it is
%   computed as the sum of the masks of the single contours.
%
%See also ac_validity, acontour.
